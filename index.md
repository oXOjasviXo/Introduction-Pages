>Adversity is the first path to truth - G.G. Byron Don Juan

I know it is not what they mean by quote but it is technically valid. :)

I don't know of any **profound** code quotes so I shall just show a *random* piece of code:

```
while(driving){
    goForward()
    dontHit()
}
```
This is a piece of code that shows of how some ~~stupid~~ people think how self driving cars work.

*<sup>This is a joke please dont take it seriously</sup>*
